# Strip

_A Less Intrusive Responsive Lightbox_

Strip is a Lightbox that only partially covers the page. This is less intrusive and leaves room to interact with the page on larger screens while giving smaller mobile devices the classic Lightbox experience.

See [stripjs.com](http://www.stripjs.com) for demos and docs.
